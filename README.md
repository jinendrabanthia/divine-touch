## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The Divine Touch interface is built around the concept of "Premium Wellness". Every interaction is designed to feel deliberate, smooth, and high-end. 
- **Typography**: Uses elegant serif fonts (like `Playfair Display`) for headings, paired with clean sans-serif fonts for body text.
- **Motion**: Animations are buttery smooth, utilizing spring physics (via Framer Motion) and robust timelines (via GSAP) to prevent jarring transitions.
- **Glassmorphism**: Subtle blurs, transparent backgrounds, and soft shadows are used to create depth without clutter.
